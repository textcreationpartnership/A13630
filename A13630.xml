            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For doubtles wherſoeuer the Generall &amp; Coronels be not readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied by their vnder Officers, but deemed &amp; iudged for deadly enemies, there must needes ariſe ſedition and mutinies, and ſo in the end, vnleſſe it be prevented, the vtter overthrowe of the whole army.

                  <p>And verely (right Reverend in the Lord) it is lamentable to behold what great maſsacres, blindnes, and ignorance, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Idolatrie do make as yet in the middeſt of many Congregations, who are laide as it were waſt and deſolate, for want, as it may be ſuppoſed, either of hability, or elſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in their Leaders which ſhould withſtand the force of

                  <p>FIrſt here the Reader may behold the pointes of faith, with the errours repugnant therevnto, referred to the Articles of our Chriſtian faith, and to the reſidue of the maine grounds and principles of our Catholike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in this collation he may perceiue both the particular pointes of faith to be a light for the better vnderſtanding of theſe grounds of faith, &amp; alſo the groundes of faith, to giue greater ſtrength for the confirmation of the particular pointes of faith, and for the confutation of the erroures that are contrary thereto.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas the people for the moſt part cannot read the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor ſo well vnderſtand and keepe in memorie the ſentences take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the Apoſtles &amp; Prophets, as they can theſe grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of our Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by reaſon of the more familiar vſe of the ſame, therefore the particular pointes of faith being made open and knowen vnto them the more eaſily by this collatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they may the ſooner hereby be brought to the knowledge of the truth, and alſo confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the ſame.</p>

And from whence I pray you, did moſt of thoſe greate Donatiues proceede, that were caſt into the treaſurie by our popiſh Phariſies? Is it not likelie that they were either part of that bootie that they gained by theſale of their Maſſes and pardons: or at the leaſt ſome portion of the fleeces which they tooke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſheepe for their little and courſe, yea no feeding at all of the flocke of Chriſt? And what then was this, but to rob Peter and to pay Paule? or it may be, it was the bringing in of <hi>the price of an whore,</hi> yea perhaps of many whores into <note place="margin">Hagg. 2. 15. Deut. 23. 18</note> the temple of God, and the offering vp of the vncleane in ſacrifice vnto him. And here by the way I would demande alſo of them, whether it be not as good and as profitable a worke both to church and common-weale to bring vp our owne natural children begotten in holy matrimony at our owne coſt and charges in ſome honeſt calling, according to our habilitie, and carefullie to provide for them conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient portions: as to leaue large ſummes to our baſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, kinsfolke, ſervants, or any other whoſoeuer, of whoſe good education as wee haue not the like care, ſo of their
<pb facs="tcp:1394:110"/> good converſation we cannot conceiue the like hope? But yet here, leaſt we be miſtaken, proteſtation is to bee made, that as we thinke not that we are borne only for our ſelues and for our children, ſo wee teach not any to employ their goods to the benefit of themſelues and their children on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo to the ſeruice of God, Prince, &amp; country, and of al other alſo, who are our neighbours, if they may bee ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured and relieved by our meanes. Yea we conſtantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch that the more in wiſedome &amp; diſcretion we imploy that way, the greater treaſure wee lay vp in the ſafeſt place not onlie to our owne beſt gaine, but alſo to the greateſt commoditie of our children. And as for thoſe which haue no children at al, there is no doubt but that the more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to be emploied to the benefit of other, if they wil ſhew their fidelitie to him, whoſe bailiffes they are in al that they poſſeſſe, and bee eſteemed of him as his faithful ſervants. And yet here it is to be remembred, that liberality is but one duty amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many, that are required in the commandements of God. it is but one branch among manie other alſo, that are to ſpring out of vs, if we wil bee good and fruitfull trees: it is but parte of that ſeruice that we muſt performe vnto God, if we wilbe acknowledged of him for his faithful ſeruants. Neither muſt we eſteeme him to be a good chriſtian, albeit the world like neuer ſo well of him, who is a ſwearer, drunkard, or whoremaſter, if ſo bee he be a good almes man, and careth not who eateth of his <note place="margin">Liberality no fitte cloake to cover ſinne</note> meate: as if this were a cloake to couer al faultes, and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient amends for al ſinnes: for this is but a counterfeit &amp; a ſhaddow of liberality, it is not true liberality indeede. For ſhee is not an whore, but a chaſt matrone: ſhee vſeth not to ſorte her ſelfe with ſuch baſe companions: ſhee ſorteth her ſelfe only with her princely peeres, and keepeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<pb facs="tcp:1394:111"/> with all the reſidue of divine and heauenly vertues. Neither doth her beauty ſo much conſiſt in the great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the outward work that is wrought, as in the readines and willingnes of the minde of the giuer: ſeeing not many rich, noble, &amp; mighty are effectually called, but the poore baſe &amp; weake of this world which are more glorious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with ſpiritual graces, then beautified with the ſhew and pompe of outward works. And yet whereas God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied mercy to no ſtate or condition, thoſe which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being rich and noble muſt know, that the more that is given vnto them, the more ſhal be required at their hands: and that they that ſowe ſparingly ſhal reape ſparingly: and ſeeing that God is ſo liberal and bountiful in all reſpectes towardes them, they ought to be liberal and bountiful for his ſake, eſpecially towards his ſincere &amp; faithful ſervants. that ſo their Lord &amp; Maſter may ſay vnto them, <hi>goe too yee good and faithfull ſervants, ye haue bin faithfull in a little, I wil make you Lordes over much, enter yee into the ioy of the Lord.</hi> And againe <hi>Come yee bleſſed of my father inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world: for I was hungry and yee fedde me.</hi> Wherfore to conclude, it is evident in part by thoſe things which haue bin hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to delivered, that our doctrine of the Goſpel is no provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſin, and that our life is not vtterly void of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all good workes: for then wee ſhould haue greatly provoked the Lord to haue pulled downe the hedge of this our vineyard, and to haue remoued his candleſticke out of the midſt of vs. But bleſſed be the Lord, the wal of this our vineyard ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth as yet, the bright candle of the ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith and good works burneth in the candleſticke of this our Church of England, the which is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince put out in the Church of Rome: and therfore howſoever they

But as for the moſt of our Prophets &amp; Apoſtles they were ſimple and ignorant men, brought vp not in famous places and ſchooles of learning, but in meane, poore, and baſe occupations: and therefore the divine knowledge of all heavenly wiſedome, wherewithal they were endued moſt plentifully, muſt needes be

Now as the perſons, from whom the bookes of the olde &amp; new teſtament proceeded, &amp; by whom the doctrine thereof was ſo louingly embraced, declare them to be divine, ſo doth the matter alſo in them contained. For where are the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of all iniquities and ſinnes ſo liuely drawen forth &amp; ſette out in their coloures, to moue to a through diſlike and hatred of them, and to vnfained repentance and amendement of life, as they are deſcribed in theſe divine bookes? And where elſe may we find ſuch a gratious mediator to reconcile vs to God, ſo great a price given for the purchaſe of the kingdome of heaven, ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and full a ſatisfaction for the diſcharge of al our ſinnes, ſuch a ſoveraigne ſalve for the curing of al our maladies, ſuch an effectu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al meanes to relieve our diſtreſled conſciences, and to ſecure vs of the loue and favour of God, as are offered vnto vs in the holie ſcriptures?

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1394:148"/> and this is alſo a great addition vnto his loue. Thirdly the Lord maketh his loue manifeſted by his bleſſings the meanes to beget and to encreaſe faith, loue, repentance and the like in the hearts of his elect and choſen children: he putteth them not out to vſe, nor taketh any encreaſe for them: (for his eſtate cannot be bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor his bleſſednes encreaſed) the profite and encreaſe accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to vs: and therefore by them we merite nothing at the hands of God, nor make him thereby any way endebted to vs, but wee our ſelues are more and more ſtill in his debt for the free lone &amp; francke gift of all his bleſſings. Now then to returne againe to the firſt point.</p>
                  <p>The loue of God is the ful fountaine of all manner of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings both bodyly and ghoſtly, and he himſelfe is not only the author, but alſo the diſpoſer and beſtower of them all: the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings themſelues, and the meanes are of him, and the working al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the one and the other. Temporal, meanes are in themſelues nothing without the ſpeciall power of God working in them &amp; by them. Man liveth not by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And life conſiſeth not in the great aboundance of all ſuch thinges a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So ſpirituall meanes alſo are nothing without the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall power of the almighty working by them: for that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule and life of all. He that planteth is nothing, and hee that watereth is nothing, but God that giveth the encreaſe. Iohn the Baptiſt can baptiſe but with water: Auſtine can but ſpeake to our bodyly eares: Chriſt baptiſeth only with the holy Ghoſt: and he that hath his chaire in heaven is he only that, can teach the heart. The water in baptiſme can but waſh the body, and the very word of the promiſe of it ſelfe without faith is but an ineffectuall and dead letter; yea the bodily preſence of Chriſtes owne fleſh profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing: it is his ſpirit that quickneth, &amp; that worketh faith and bringeth life.

So in the primitiue church albeit Liberius biſhop of Rome ſtood after a fort <hi>alone</hi> againſt the Arrians in the defence of the moſt Catholike doctrine of the divine nature of the coeſſential and conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſon of God, and interpreted the ſcriptures for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that faith, yet his <hi>alonenes</hi> made not his interpretations pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but that they were moſt catholike and ſounde.

                  <p>Vnder the time of the law, for that in the bookes of Moſes all points of faith were not ſet downe with ſuch perſpicuity &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that they could be ſo fully &amp; eaſily vnderſtood then, as they may now vnder the goſpel, therfore the Lord raiſed vp vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many vnerring interpreters for the ſupplying of that defect.

But now al revelations are ceaſed, and the rayſing vp of vnerring interpreters is come to an end, for that in the writings of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts al points of faith neceſſary to ſalvation are ſet down with al perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and plainenes, and for that alſo there is very great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſpirit given to al the faithful ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Chriſt, which

The Apoſtle Saint Iohn writing to the <note place="margin">1.

Not that the continual miniſtery of paſtours and Doctors is not ſtil needfull for the people of God: but the meaning is, that the doctrine firſt taught by the mouth of the Apoſtles, &amp; afterward ſet downe in their Canonical writings is ſo plaine, evident, and ful to the ſervants of Chriſt which are endued with his ſpirit, that they need not now, at vnder the law, any vnerring teacher ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary for the further opening of any neceſſary point of faith, which otherwiſe might be ſecret and lye hid.

For al neceſſary things are ſet downe ſo plainly in the bookes of the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts by him that was beſt able to write even to the capacity of the moſt ſimple, who cauſed alſo thoſe bookes to be penned not to obſcure but to lighten the truth, that the lambe may wade in them without danger of drowning, and drinke moſt plentifully of thoſe vvaters of life: yea the vvary of Gods ſervice is now ſo

The pointes of faith contained in theſe bookes neede neither to begge credite, <note place="margin">All thinges neceſſary to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſette downe ſo plainely in the bookes of the new teſtament, that all the faithfull may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of an vnerring Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yea without the helpe of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter at all.</note> nor to take light from the writings &amp; expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men, but haue their credite in themſelues, &amp; take their light from themſelues, &amp; giue light &amp; credit both to the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; alſo to the bokes of al other who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoever, that haue any credite or light in them. And the maine grounds of faith contained in them ſtand vpon their owne ground, &amp; haue in themſelues moſt manifeſt perſpicuity, that the mind paſſing through many forms of opinions being once light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therwith, may reſolue &amp; ſettle his ful aſſent &amp; conſent vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the helpe of any vnerring Interpreter, yea without the helpe of any Interpreter at all. For what containe the bookes of the new teſtament, but the vncovering of that which was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the old? Now if thoſe things be vncovered already, what neede haue they of a further vncovering? Vnleſſe we thinke that the Apoſtles themſelues, which had the greateſt meaſure of the ſpirite, and the largeſt portion of knowledge in the miſteries of God, had either not ſo good skill or will to ſett downe plainly in their Canonicall writings all points of faith, as their ſchollers and ſucceſſors had in their writings which are not Canonicall. The truth is that all thinges neceſſarie vnto ſalvation are novve moſt plainly delivered in the bookes of the new teſtament: &amp; the beſt Interpreters doe not by their expoſitions bring any new light at all vnto them, but pointe as it were with the finger to that light which is in them, that we may turne our eies vpon it, &amp; togither with them behould the ſame: they bring no grounds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their owne, that thereby they may lighten the doctrine of the ſcripture: but they hould out the grounds &amp; principles of the ſcripture it ſelfe, that therby they may lighten all that is obſcure. For albeit in the divine ſcriptures there are many places darke, &amp; obſcure, &amp; hard to be vnderſtoode, &amp; ſuch wherein the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters themſelues may erre &amp; be deceaved, yet (as S.

And verely if it bee a good reaſon againſt vs (as it hath beene ſette forth not long ſince by one of her Pamphleters) that the vnlearned among vs haue no faith at all but a meere fancie becauſe they doe builde it vppon our bare tranſlations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to examine the truth of them by the originalles: then much more may vvee avouch, that neither the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor yet the learned themſelues among them haue anie faith at all, ſeeing they all muſt, vvill they vvill they, ſettle their faith vppon the vvoordes and meaning of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator, albeit hee differ never ſo much from the originall. VVherefore to conclude, ſeeing the Church of Rome hath embraced all manner of meanes of falling avvaie from GOD and his truth, vvee may bee boulde to affirme that ſhee hath revolted and played the Apoſtata, and ſo is become not onelie hereticall but alſo apoſtaticall, yea that ſhee hath brought in that great apoſtaſy, that was foretolde by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
                  <p>Thus haſt thou gentle Reader delivered vnto thee the maine foundation of all good workes, &amp; the foure principall motiues ſo often vrged in the divine ſcripture to ſtirre vp the faithfull to the right and approued manner that is to be kept in the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all holy actions.

Now it remaineth that thou carefully put in practiſe theſe holy precepts and ſanctified rules, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art moued to the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of any good worke, and that thou ſtirre vp the gift of God in thee by theſe or the like holy meditations, thus reaſoning with thy ſelfe and ſaying: This good worke God himſelfe in his holy word commandeth me to performe, vnto whoſe will I owe all obedience, for that it is holy, pure, &amp; perfect, &amp; gratefull and acceptable to himſelfe, &amp; alſo for that it is his will vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I am ten thouſand times bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to yeeld al dutiful ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; obedience both in reſpect of his ſoveraigne auctority, that he only hath to rule over my conſcience &amp; ſoule, &amp; alſo in regard of his infinite bleſſings, which he of his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable goodnes in Chriſt hath moſt freely &amp; fully beſtowed vpon me. And verely our obedience performed to the vvill of God in theſe reſpectes is a ſweete incenſe and a moſt acceptable ſacrifice to God, wherwith we after a ſort gratifie God and grieve the Devill, &amp; are as an heaven to all holy Angels, and a very hell vnto al vncleane ſpirits. So like wiſe when we are tempted to any wicked worke, wee muſt thus reaſon with ourſelues and ſay: this worke ought in no wiſe to be done by me, no not the leaſt deſire to accompliſh the ſame ought once to haue any entrance into my hart, becauſe it is contrary to the holy, pure, &amp; perfect will of God, &amp; agreeable vnto the impure will of the Devill: becauſe it is moſt offenſiue &amp; grievous to God, &amp; moſt gratefull &amp; accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto the Devill: becauſe it is a great diſhonour to him, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all honour is double due, both in reſpect of his ſoveraigne aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over me, and alſo in regard of his manifolde mercies collated vpon me: and it is a great honour vnto that moſt cruell and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tyrant the Devill, who preſſeth vpon me thereby to take me captive, to the vtter deſtruction both of my body and ſoule. We are debters (as ſaith the Apoſtle) yea very great debters, &amp; as great as great may be, but not to the fleſh, nor to our ſelues, nor <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 12.</note> to the devil (vnles it be that we owe to theſe al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of evils &amp; miſeries whatſoever) but we are debtters to God, &amp; that for the loue of a thouſand talents, &amp; for the gift of ten thouſand more: &amp;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1394:170"/> yet if we haue but a ſincere deſire to diſcharge this our debt, our moſt gracious creditour will not onely ſtraitwaies forgiue it all, but alſo wil giue vnto vs ten thouſand times more. Yea the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire of being obedient to the will of God vpon the former reſpects, and the true care according as God hath enabled vs in ſome meaſure to diſcharge this our debt is a very great mercy &amp; a very gracious favour, wherby we are more and more endebtted vnto him. And verely this is al the diſcharge of our debt that hee requireth at our hands, that we willingly &amp; gladly acknowledge him of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue received all, &amp; that we ſo highly eſteeme of his giftes, and preſume of his good will, that we are ſtil deſirous to been debtted vnto him more &amp; more, &amp; by al relligious hearing, reading, and meditating vpon his holy and ſacred word, &amp; by all ſervent and devout praier bee continually begging and craving for more, and after a ſort extorting it out of his handes. For his deſire is not to be benifited by vs, but that we ſhould ſtill more and more bee benefited by him: and hee vvould haue vs to acknowledge his loue, and to grovve into a ſtedfaſt aſſurance therof, that therby we might be more effectually ſtirred vp to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in his goodnes, &amp; to be thankful vnto him for his manifold mercies: eſpecially he would haue vs moſt midfully to record that vnmatchable bleſſing of our redemption wrought by Chriſt, &amp; his ineſtimable loue made manifeſt therin, that therby our hearts might be renewed &amp; our affections ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified, dying to our ſelues, &amp; living to God, &amp; employing our ſelues to every good worke. And hereof it is that the ſpirit of God eſpecially in the bookes of the new teſtament doth ſo often make mention of Chriſt, and of our redemption wrought by him, and of his great loue manifeſted therein, as being the matter and ſubiect of thoſe bookes: a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>No man hath ſoone God at any time: the onely begotten ſonne of God vvho is in the boſome of the father, hee hath revealed him.</hi> Ioh, 1. 18. The Philoſophers in all ages haue moſt painfully ſearched after truth in their Phyſikes, Ethikes, Mathematikes, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1394:171"/> reſt. But the knowledge of the Father in the Sonne doth only deſerue the name of truth. For to what purpoſe is it to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in minde heaven and earth and all other thinges, if a ſinner doth not knowe God in Chriſt the redeemer? That is, vnleſſe he feele God favourable vnto him, and forgiving him all his ſinnes in Chriſt, which only doeth pacifie the troubled conſcience, hee can haue little true comfort in all his knovve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all other things, be it never ſo great, and ſmal courage to come vnto God, and to reſt in him, and ſo to take hold of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting bleſſednes. Therefore our Saviour himſelfe, after that he had ſaid, <hi>no man knoweth the father but the ſonne, and hee to whom the ſonne hath revealed him,</hi> Math. 11. 28. immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: <hi>Come vnto mee all yee that are wearie and heavy laden, and I will refreſh you.</hi> VVhereby hee ſignifieth, that God being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Chriſt, there doeth follovve peace of conſcience and vnſpeakeable ioy in all thoſe that doe caſt their ſinnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>

For as the Iewes were ignoraunt that Chriſt the lambe of God ſhoulde bee offered vppe in ſacrifice, ſo vvee after a ſort haue forgotten that hee hath beene ſacrificed, and hath already ſuffered for our ſinnes.

The which if it bee ſo, then vve muſt hold this for a ſure thing, that wee ought not to be grieved ſo much for that we haue broken the commandement of God, as for that wee haue forgotten that wee were redeemed by the bloode of Chriſt, and haue contemned the great price of our moſt glorious redemption. VVherefore that wee may be brought the ſooner to repentaunce, and to acknowledge the greatneſſe of our ſinne vve muſt all our whole life be buſied about this, that we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande hovve great is that price of our redemption, and that vve may ſo worthyly eſteeme of the blood of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as we ought to do.</p>
                  <p>It followeth in the nexte verſe. <hi>And the two diſciples heard him ſo speaking, and they follovved Ieſus,</hi> Ioh. 1. 37. That teſtimony which Iohn the Baptiſt gaue of Chriſt, that he was the lambe of God, before two of his diſciples, cauſeth them to come to Chriſt and to follow him. Whereby wee learne how effectuall is the preaching of Chriſt, yea how powerfull is one worde or two concerning. Chriſt and his croſſe, to alter and change the very heartes of men. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily there is no other ſpeech whereby a ſtony hart may be made fleſh, and an vnfaithfull man may be made faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Speake as much as thou liſte of the moſt famous factes of all the Kinges and Emperours that ever haue beene and of their goodly vertues and great glory, theſe things may delight the minds of men, but they wil not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevv them. But ſpeake thou of the man crucified, a thing in ſhevv baſe and fooliſh, this vvord of the croſſe, which is fooliſhnes to them that periſh, is the wiſdome &amp; power of God to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſaved: Nay that we may let paſſe theſe profane perſons with their deedes, teach againe &amp; againe the very law of God, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>law is weak by reaſon of the fleſh.</hi>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1394:172"/> But that which the law cannot, the worde of the croſſe can. Now what is the cauſe of this great efficacie? The Lord which is the matter and ſubiect of this word is a ſpirit, which is able to ſet our harts at liberty: in ſo much that if they be once fixed vpon him, the vaile of corruption, which before did ſo cleaue vnto vs, wil ſoone be taken away: and if we do duely looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that glory of his, which doth ſhine in the goſpel as in a glaſſe we ſhall be changed into the ſame image from glory to glory as by the ſpirit of God.</p>

                     <hi>Before Phillip called thee I ſaw thee, when thou waſt vnder the figge tree Ioh.</hi> 1. 48. The more any one doth ſearch into the vnſearchable riches of Chriſt, and the greater revelation hee hath of the ſame, the more is his faith and loue alſo encreaſed, and the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable and glorious is his ioy. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 1. 8. Wherefore this ought to be our continuall labour day and night, by praier and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and meditating vpon the ſcriptures to ſeeke after the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, that ſo at the length there may be opened vnto vs the treaſures of all knowledge and vnderſtanding that are hid in him, and ſo al other things may be vnto vs as traſh in compariſon of that ineſtimable treaſure. It is ſtrange to ſee how the Apoſtle that looked moſt into that excellent miſtery, could never ſatisfie himſelfe in ſetting forth and amplifying the greatneſſe thereof. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is rich in mercy of his great loue wherwith he loved vs.</hi> Eph. 2. 4. <hi>Hath given vnto vs ſo worthy a Saviour, in whom are bid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge.</hi> Coll. 2. 3. <hi>Haue care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that yee may be able to comprehend what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints.</hi> Eph. 1. 18.

As they which beheld the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were healed of the ſting of the fiery ſerpents, which otherwiſe could not bee cured: So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding of Chriſt lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp vppon the croſſe doth cure vs of the moſt deadly ſting of the ſpirituall ſerpent the Devill. It may ſeeme ſtrange that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1394:173"/> the beholding of a deade man ſhould have ſuch vertue &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy as to giue life to the behoulders: &amp; yet ſo it is, for that this dead body is a quickning ſpirit, and the word of his croſſe is the power of God to ſalvation to all that beleeue. And indeede you cannot duely thinke vpon this ſhamefull &amp; ignominious croſſe, but that yee ſhall be moved thereby to call to mind the moſt glorious and admirable loue of God, who ſo loved the world that he gaue his only begotten ſonne, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh but haue life everlaſting. Now if God loue vs, &amp; be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs? if he hath confirmed his loue towards vs, in that he ſpared not his only begotten ſonne, but gaue him for vs all, how may wee be moſt fully aſſured that he will with him giue vs al things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? <hi>Hereby</hi> (ſaith S.

Rom. 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith vnto thee give mee drinke, thou wouldeſt haue asked of him and he would haue given vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee the water of life.</hi> Ioh. 4. 10. In teaching the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we muſt labour eſpecially to worke in them a thirſt of the water of life: the ſweetnes wherof if we had once taſted, al other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs would grow out of taſt with vs, and we would after a ſort thirſt only after this water. This water of life then aboue al other things is to be made knowen to the people of God, &amp; the vertue therof is continually to be ſette forth, ſeeing it is not condemned, but where it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen. And hereof it is that Chriſt himſelfe, his ſpirit, his ſpouſe and all his faithfull members beſtow ſo much labour in pointing, to this full fountaine of the water of life, and in commending the vertues therof. <hi>I am the living bread</hi> (ſaith our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>that</hi>
